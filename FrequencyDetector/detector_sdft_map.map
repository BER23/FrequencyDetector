Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:175 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_enable_BUFGP/enable_BUFGP/BUFG" (output
   signal=enable_BUFGP) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. Some of the
   non-clock loads are (maximum of 5 listed):
   Pin CE of sdft/s1.re_0
   Pin CE of sdft/s1.re_1
   Pin CE of sdft/s1.re_2
   Pin CE of sdft/s1.re_3
   Pin CE of sdft/s1.re_4

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
